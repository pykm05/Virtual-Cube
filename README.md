## Virtual Cube

Virtual Cube is a platform that allows cubers to play against each other using keyboard controlled rubiks cubes.

⚠️ The project is currently in early development phase

## Getting started

Download the project:

```console
git clone https://github.com/pykm05/virtual-cube
cd virtual-cube
```

This project uses two servers so you'll need to first run the socket / game server:

```console
npm run dev
```

Then run the webserver:

```console
npm run next
```

The project should be running on your browser at `localhost:3000/play`
